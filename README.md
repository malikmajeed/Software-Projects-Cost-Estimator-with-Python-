# Software-Projects-Cost-Estimator-with-Python-
The Software Project Cost Estimator is a web-based application designed to provide accurate cost estimations  for software projects. The estimator uses Data Science learning algorithms and regression techniques to predict  the cost based on project details such as the number of lines of code, complexity, team experience, and  development time.
