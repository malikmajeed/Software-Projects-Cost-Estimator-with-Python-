# Software Project Cost Estimator

A web-based application designed to provide accurate cost estimations for software projects using data science techniques. The estimator predicts costs based on inputs such as the number of lines of code, complexity, team experience, and development time.

## Overview

Estimating software project costs is a critical step in project planning and resource allocation. Manual estimation methods are often time-consuming, prone to errors, and lack precision. This project automates the estimation process using regression models, ensuring reliable and accurate predictions while saving time and effort.
